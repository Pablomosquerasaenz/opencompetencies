<a name="top"></a>Open Competencies - Glossary
===
It is important to have a glossary, so that we all share a common understanding of the terms used to design this tool.  The final site should have a public-facing glossary, but for now this is an internal document so that developers are on the same page.

In competency-based education, or competency education for short, each student is given a map of all the things they could learn in high school.  Based on each student's post-high school goals, we specify the learning targets that each student needs to meet.  When a student meets all of their learning targets at the appropriate [performance level](#performance_level), they graduate.  There is no ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade; if a student takes two years to finish their map, they graduate in two years.  If they take six years, they graduate in six years.

The definition of an academic “subject area” may seem obvious, but it is important to define this term as we bring non-academic subjects into the system.  It is fairly straightforward to define the traditional academic subject areas such as Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and English.

One of the advantages of a comprehensive system such as Open Competencies is the freedom we have to define anything and everything we might like young people to learn.  We want to value important skills such as programming, and important character traits such as honesty and reliability.  Which subjects do these traits and skills fall under?  A well-structured system forces us to answer this question, and answering this kind of question frees us to bring anything we identify as important to student success into the system.

<a name="subdiscipline_area"></a>subdiscipline area
---
These are the sub-areas of a subject.  For example, if Science is a subject area, then Physical Science is a subdiscipline area.  So we have:
- Science (subject area)
    - Physical Science (subdiscipline area)

A subject area does not need to have any subdiscipline areas.  Subdiscipline areas may also be referred to as subject disciplines.
