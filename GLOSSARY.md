<a name="top"></a>Open Competencies - Glossary
===
It is important to have a glossary, so that we all share a common understanding of the terms used to design this tool.  The final site should have a public-facing glossary, but for now this is an internal document so that developers are on the same page.

In competency-based education, or competency education for short, each student is given a map of all the things they could learn in high school.  Based on each student's post-high school goals, we specify the learning targets that each student needs to meet.  When a student meets all of their learning targets at the appropriate [performance level](#performance_level), they graduate.  There is no ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade; if a student takes two years to finish their map, they graduate in two years.  If they take six years, they graduate in six years.
