Broad scope of Open Learning Tools
---
Open Learning Tools is a collection of tools that help support schools, organizations, and individuals to implement competency-based education. [rest of this already written?]

Overview of three components:  Open Competencies, Open Curriculum Builder, Open Learning Tracker
---
Initial development is focusing on just the first tool.  However, it is important to have a basic understanding of the collection of tools that needs to be built.  This will help constrain the scope of the first component.

Open Competencies is a map of all topics that a person could learn. You click on one topic in the map, and other topics in the map light up, depending on how they are related to the topic you clicked.  This allows you to quickly identify a path from what you know now to what you want to know.  Open Competencies is NOT a curriculum.  It does not link to any specific learning resources; it is just an interactive set of targets.

Open Curriculum Builder is a tool for building learning projects, lessons, curriculum, and assessments from the Open Competencies map.  It lets educators focus on the interesting and challenging parts of designing high-quality curriculum.  It lets educators easily share their work, collaborate, and guides them into effective models of education.  It brings the obvious software development concepts of forking and version control to education.  It is also valuable to parents wanting to guide their children's education, to homeschool parents, and to individual learners who want to outline their own learning projects.
