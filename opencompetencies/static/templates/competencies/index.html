	   </div>
		<div class="span11 offset1">
		  <p class="text-left">Most education standards are written by a group of people who are pulled together for the specific purpose of writing a set of standards. This might be a number of people from around a state education system who are pulled together throughout a school year to develop an individual state's standards, or it might be a group that is sponsored full-time to develop a set of standards.</p>
		  <p class="text-left">The main problem with this model is that the sponsoring group almost always retains copyright over the standards that are developed. Using these standards commits you to going wherever this sponsoring body leads.</p>

		  <p class="lead text-left">How Open Competencies helps:
	   </div>
		<div class="span11 offset1">
		  <p class="text-left">Open Competencies makes it easy to develop your own set of education standards, by giving you a dedicated tool for creating standards. Right now you can start from scratch, or you can start with a copy of another school's system. Soon you will be able to start from scratch, and bring in any group of standards from any other school to create your own mix of standards that suit your students' needs.</p>

		<div class="span11 offset1">
		  <p class="text-left">To create a new school, you will have to be logged in. Open Competencies is in an invite-only alpha stage of development, but there is a guest account you can use to try things out. You can <a href='{% url 'login' %}'>log in</a> with the username 'guest' and the password 'guest', and you will be able to <a href='{% url 'competencies:schools' %}'>create your own school</a>.</p>

	   </div>
		<div class="span11 offset1">
		  <p class="text-left">There are many obstacles that get in the way of one school adopting another school's successful program. There are financial obstacles; even spending a few hundred dollars on a new system can take a long time to find the money, and get a payment approved and completed. There is the bureaucratic obstacle of helping other people get on board with a new system, probably while viewing a demo version of the product, which they may not have full confidence in. There are technical obstacles, figuring out how to integrate a new system into a school's existing software environment.</p>
		  <p class="text-left">This difficulty goes both ways. If your school has a system that works well and you want to share it with another school, it can be difficult or impossible for you as an individual to share your school's system.</p>

		  <p class="lead text-left">How Open Competencies helps:
	   </div>
		<div class="span11 offset1">
		  <p class="text-left">Say you are at an education conference, and you show a teacher from another school the standards that your school uses on Open Competencies. If that teacher wants to use your system at their school, they can register an individual account in less than a minute, make a new school, and copy your school's system in one click. They can then go back to their school and begin using their own copy of your standards, and they are free to revise them to meet the specific needs of their students.</p>

However, you can <a href='{% url 'login' %}'>log in</a> under the username 'guest', with the password 'guest'. Once you do this, you can <a href='{% url 'competencies:schools' %}'>create a new school</a> and then "fork" an existing school's competencies. This gives you your own copy of that school's competencies, which you can modify as you please.</p>

		<div class="span11 offset1">
		  <p class="text-left">Most districts and schools publish one set of graduation requirements, which are usually aimed at students who plan to go to a four-year-college. There is usually some flexibility within these requirements, but different career pathways are usually not very well defined for most high school students.</p>

		<div class="span11 offset1">
		  <p class="text-left">Open Competencies allows you to create different "Pathways" through your competency system. A Pathway is simply a named set of elements within your system. Students could then be set up to follow a certain pathway tailored to their career interest.</p>
		  <p class="text-left">This ability to identify different graduation requirements for individual students, based on their post-high school plans, is one of the main features of Open Competencies.</p>

		  <p class="text-left">There are many good education-related resources available now, but many of them have important financial and proprietary issues.
