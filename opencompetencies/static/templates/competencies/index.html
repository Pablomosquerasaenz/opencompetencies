		<p class="text-left">Most education standards are written by a group of people who are pulled together for the specific purpose of writing a set of standards. This might be a number of people from around a state education system who are pulled together throughout a school year to develop an individual state's standards, or it might be a group that is sponsored full-time to develop a set of standards.</p>
		<p class="text-left">The main problem with this model is that the sponsoring group almost always retains control over the standards that are developed. Using these standards commits you to going wherever this sponsoring body leads.</p>

Right now you can start with an empty template, and develop a set of standards for an entire school or for a single subject. When Open Competencies is complete you'll be able to start from scratch, or build on the standards any other school has developed.</p>

		<hr>
		<p class="text-left">There are many good education-related resources available now, but many of them have significant financial and proprietary issues. Proprietary resources will never foster widespread adoption of truly innovativate approaches to education. Charging money for educational resources, while appropriate at times, significantly increases the friction involved in adopting those resources. There is a strong need for high-quality, fully open educational resources.</p>
