		<p class="lead text-left"><span class="problem_label">Problem:</span> Most education standards are written by an external body, and are not subject to continuous revision.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-left">Most education standards are written by a group of people who are pulled together for the specific purpose of writing a set of standards. This might be a number of people from around a state education system who are pulled together throughout a school year to develop an individual state's standards, or it might be a group that is sponsored full-time to develop a set of standards.</p>
		<p class="text-left">The main problem with this model is that the sponsoring group almost always retains copyright over the standards that are developed. Using these standards commits you to going wherever this sponsoring body leads.</p>

Right now you can start from scratch, or you can start with a copy of another school's system. Soon you will be able to start from scratch, and bring in any group of standards from any other school to create your own mix of standards that suit your students' needs.</p>

		<hr>
		<p class="text-left">There are many obstacles that get in the way of one school adopting another school's successful program. There are financial obstacles; even spending a few hundred dollars on a new system can take a long time to find the money, and get a payment approved and completed. There is the bureaucratic obstacle of helping other people get on board with a new system, probably while viewing a demo version of the product, which they may not have full confidence in. There are technical obstacles, figuring out how to integrate a new system into a school's existing software environment.</p>
		<p class="text-left">This difficulty goes both ways. If your school has a system that works well and you want to share it with another school, it can be difficult or impossible for you as an individual to share your school's system.</p>

			 <p class="text-left"><span class="problem_label">Open Competencies</span> makes it easier for schools to share each other's resources. Say you are at an education conference, and you show a teacher from another school the standards that your school uses on Open Competencies. If that teacher wants to use your system they can register an individual account in less than a minute, make a new school, and copy your school's system in one click. They can then go back to their school and begin using their own copy of your standards, and they are free to revise them to meet the specific needs of their students.</p>

		<p class="text-left">Most districts and schools publish one set of graduation requirements, which are usually aimed at students who plan to go to a four-year-college.

		<p class="text-left">There are many good education-related resources available now, but many of them have important financial and proprietary issues. Proprietary resources will never foster widespread adoption of truly innovativate approaches to education. Charging money for educational resources, while appropriate at times, significantly increases the friction involved in adopting those resources. There is a strong need for high-quality, fully open educational resources.</p>
