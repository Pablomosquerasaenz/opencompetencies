      <h1>Welcome to Open Competencies</h1>
		<h2>(pre-alpha demo version)</h2>
		<p>To kick the tires, which are very tiny and wobbly at this early stage, click on the link below to view existing schools.</p>
		<p>Poke around the <a href='{% url 'competencies:schools' %}'>existing schools</a> briefly, then go back and <a href='{% url 'competencies:schools' %}'>create your own school</a>.  If you create your own school, you will be able to fork an existing school's system.  This is a demo of the first main feature of the Open Competencies project.</p>
		<p>You can also check out a <a href='{% url 'competencies:pathways' 1 %}'>sample pathway</a>. A pathway is a collection of related elements of the competency system. One use of a pathway is to represent all of the learning targets required for a certain career. Each pathway belongs to a particular school, so there is no direct link to all pathways.</p>
		<p>If you are a developer, you can check out the code from <a href="https://github.com/openlearningtools/opencompetencies">github</a>. You can share <a href="https://github.com/openlearningtools/opencompetencies/issues/2">feedback</a> there as well.</p>
