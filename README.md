Vision
-------
Open Competencies is a dynamic list of all the information you could learn.  It is a tree of knowledge, with different relationships identified between all of the bits of knowledge.

How do you use it?  Let's say you want to be a professional programmer.  You click a button, and all of the bits of knowledge needed to be a programmer light up.  You realize you don't just want to be a programmer.  You  also want to write really well, not just about technical topics.  So you click a few buttons that describes how you want to use writing in your life.  All of the bits that relate to writing well light up.

A separate tool will let you take a copy of your learning targets, and track your progress in learning them.  That needs to be a separate tool, because it requires a different kind of security model.

Use Cases
---------
- You are a school that wants to implement competency education.  You interview new students as they come into your school.  You make a map of what each student needs to learn during their time in high school.  When they finish their map, they graduate from high school.
- You are a parent.  You use Open Competencies to help your child figure out what to focus on, and to track their progress regardless of where their learning comes from.
- You are a recent college graduate.  No one is telling you what to focus on anymore.  You use Open Competencies to lay out your lifelong learning goals.
